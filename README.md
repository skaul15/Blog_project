# EduGorilla_internship_task
A blog site made using Python and Django - a python web framework. This is like a regular blog. The user can create posts, edit/update them and delete them.
The user also has a choice to either pulish their posts or keep them as drafts which can then later be published.
The user can also post comments on each other's posts and have functionality to either approve or not approve comments.
This project is made almost according to the internship task as described(some features may differ).

The blog has user registration functionality and latest posts are displayed.
This is just like blog/social media site we use in daily life.

You can download all dependencies/modules used in this project which are listed in requirements.txt file using this command
"pip freeze > requirements.txt"
